        <span>I went to school,</span>
        2005-2008
    </dt>
    <dd>
        I went to the <a href="http://www.unc.edu" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> in the fall of 2005 with the intent to be a German and English double major. That, however, changed quite a bit over the next couple years. I took courses in virtually every area; from archaeology and poetry to advanced genetics and computer science. In the end, however, I decided to check out a year early and graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.A. in German in May 2008.

    <dt>
        <span>Did some contract work,</span>

        While I was at Chapel Hill, I worked as a contractor doing web development for a number of companies. I worked for <a href="http://www.trainone.com" target="_blank">Train One</a>, the technical component of the <a href="http://gitomer.com" target="_blank">BuyGitomer</a> empire, as an intern turned contractor on an internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">CRM</a>. The next summer, I had the pleasure of working at <a href="http://modevisual.com" target="_blank">MODE Visual</a>, again as an intern turned contractor, but this time on some sites you might've heard of: <a href="http://newbalance.com" target="_blank">newbalance.com</a>, <a href="http://puma.com" target="_blank">puma.com</a>, and <a href="http://diderot.com" target="_blank">diderot.com</a>. While working at MODE, I wrote my first web framework in PHP and thus began my <a href="/projects" target="_blank">obsession</a> with web development. Thereafter, I met the folks at <a href="http://skookum.com" target="_blank">Skookum</a> and worked as a contractor for a few months before they decided to hire me full time.

        <span>Provided some technical leadership,</span>
        2008-2009
    </dt>
    <dd>
        At Skookum I did a bit of everything; from establishing our <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">version control</a> system to quoting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)" target="_blank">architecting</a> sites that came to us. While I designed the entire backend for <a href="http://diderot.com" target="_blank">diderot.com</a> at MODE (a project with over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code" target="_blank">100,000+ LoC</a>), some of the sites we developed at Skookum pushed the limits of web technology and a number of them used the <a href="/projects" target="_blank">frameworks</a> I had developed. Clean, for example, was used to build <a href="http://lordpeacock.com" target="_blank">Lord Peacock</a> as well as an insane internal tool that we were calling the Resource Management System. While I was with Skookum, I led a number of projects working with 2-4 other developers at a time and it was here that I really started to cultivate my desire to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_programmer" target="_blank">technical leader</a>. In the end, however, I wanted to have a broader depth of experiences and I needed a place to really grow that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Should-Anyone-Led-You/dp/1578519713" target="_blank">ability to lead</a>. As such, I moved to a little town outside of Seattle: Redmond, WA.

        Redmond, WA happens to be where <a href="http://microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> is located, and they just so happened to have hired me. I left all of my <a href="http://php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>, and <a href="http://ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> code behind and traded it for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-C-Second-Tom-Archer/dp/0735616485" target="_blank">C#</a> and Visual Studio. I worked at Microsoft as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Things-Happen-Mastering-Management/dp/0596517718" target="_blank">Program Manager</a>, which meant I do all of the stuff that doesn't happen to get done by others. Given my strong technical background, my placement on <a href="http://visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> seemed fitting and I found myself frequently still working with code. Being a PM, however, also offered me a chance to really dive into some of the other things I have a serious passion for; <a href="http://www.ideo.com" target="_blank">design</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655" target="_blank">public speaking</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myths-Innovation-Scott-Berkun/dp/0596527055" target="_blank">innovation</a>, and connecting with <a href="http://www.gitomer.com/Customer-Loyalty-Concepts-pluCLCFLIPBOOK.html" target="_blank">customers</a>. While I was at Microsoft, I worked on a demo for an <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/178261.asp" target="_blank">audience of 40,000+</a>, helped partners (read: <a href="http://www.intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.nvidia.com" target="_blank">Nvidia</a>, etc) integrate with VS, designed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/visualstudio/archive/2010/01/07/tips-and-tricks-zooming-in-the-vs-2010-editor.aspx" target="_blank">features</a> in VS2010, and represented the new wave of <a href="http://mef.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">MEF extensibility</a> in the IDE. About a year into it, I even moved to own the entire VB and C# IDE experience and worked on the future of what it means to be a development tool. In the end, however, the allure of the web was just too much.</dd>

        <span>The next big thing?</span>
        2010-Current
    </dt>
    <dd>After about two years, I left Microsoft to start a company with my good friend <a href="http://nathanhammond.com">Nathan Hammond</a>. Nathan and I have known each other since high school, we both worked at Skookum and MODE together, and have always wanted to strike out on our own. Currently, we're working on several ideas, the first of which, a <a href="http://www.typewire.io">live-blogging service</a>, is now in beta. It's been an insane <a href="http://radian.org/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/20080404-img_2281.jpg">roller coaster ride</a> so far, but it's undoubtedly one of the best learning experiences I could ever have.</dd>

        Throughout all of this, I've developed a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162" target="_blank">unique skillset</a>. My eclectic background and general passion for solving problems and learning new things means I approach situations from angles most people haven't even dreamed of yet. I admit, I'm different (how many German majors do you know at Microsoft?), but I promise it's for the best.
