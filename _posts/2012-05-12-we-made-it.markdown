After an amazing showing by the development community, [Light Table][ks] has hit its goal of $200,000 with 20 days left to go! I want to extend my sincerest thanks to all of you who have helped spread the word, and committed to a future of a better tools. It has been an amazing past couple of weeks that has given me a chance to talk to some of the best and brightest in the business. I think as a group of builders we're ready to finally see our tools work for us and I'm honored that you've put your faith in me to do that.

I've been quiet over the past couple weeks as I've been putting together a demo to show the real power of what's to come and I can't wait to show it to you all. I'll give you a little hint: I've been making a lot of sssSSSSssssSSssss noises lately ;)
