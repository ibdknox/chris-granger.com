Just a few moments ago our [Kickstarter campaign][ks] closed with a truly amazing 7,317 backers at $316,720. It's been such a whirlwind story over the past 45 days from a simple blog post to what is now a funded startup, a successful kickstarter campaign, and a seat at [the YC table][yc].

None of that would have been possible without the faith and dedication of all of you. For your support, I give you my sincerest thanks. Now it's up to us to deliver the future we've envisioned. I hope you're as excited as we are. It's going to be a wild ride.
