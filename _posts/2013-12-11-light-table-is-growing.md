I'm happy to finally announce that we have a new addition to the Light Table team: [Jamie Brandon](http://scattered-thoughts.net/) will be joining us, coming all the way from sunny old England. Jamie brings some much needed British civility (what else could you possibly learn at Cambridge and Oxford?) to our otherwise lawless duo of merry men. He also happens to be incredibly passionate about getting people the tools they need to do amazing things, the future of technological colaboration, and changing the way we create our world. We've been searching for the right person to add to the team for quite some time now and we've finally found them. Check out [Jamie's blog post](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2013/12/12/no-more-bullshit/) to see what he has to say on the matter.

But we've also been growing in other ways. We now have well over 10,000 people using Light Table every month, doing more than 3 years worth of continuous work in that time. And as of the [2013 State of Clojure Survey](http://cemerick.com/2013/11/18/results-of-the-2013-state-of-clojure-clojurescript-survey/), we've become the 3rd most popular editor for Clojure, being beaten only by Emacs and VIM. But in the startup world, everything seems to be about growth over time, and we've done pretty well there too.

We've grown our usage by over 20% on average every month for the past year and a half. All of that has come from you guys helping us spread the word, and for that we thank you. It's been a good year for Light Table and I'll say that with what's ahead, things are just getting started.

So with our first year and a half behind us and our team now 50% larger than before, we have some awesome things coming in the not too distant future - a *big* release in the first week of the new year and maybe even a sneak peek of "Aurora" before too long.

Happy Holidays everyone and I hope you'll join us in shaking things up in 2014!
